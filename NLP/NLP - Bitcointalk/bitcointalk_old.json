Wait until it has completely\nshut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the\ninstaller (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)\nor `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).\nThe first time you run version 0.15.0 or higher, your chainstate database will\nbe converted to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to\nhalf an hour, depending on the speed of your machine.\nThe file format of `fee_estimates.dat` changed in version 0.15.0. Hence, a\ndowngrade from version 0.15 or upgrade to version 0.15 will cause all fee\nestimates to be discarded.\nNote that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no\nautomatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. Upgrading\ndirectly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.\nHowever, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.\nDowngrading warning\n-------------------\nThe chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous\nreleases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any\nolder version, you will need to run the old release with the `-reindex-chainstate`\noption to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.\nIf your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and\nprocessing the entire blockchain.\nCompatibility\n==============\nBitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.\nBitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\nfrequently tested on them.\nNotable changes\n===============\nNetwork fork safety enhancements\n--------------------------------\nA number of changes to the way Bitcoin Core deals with peer connections and invalid blocks\nhave been made, as a safety precaution against blockchain forks and misbehaving peers.\n- Unrequested blocks with less work than the minimum-chain-work are now no longer processed even\nif they have more work than the tip (a potential issue during IBD where the tip may have low-work).\nThis prevents peers wasting the resources of a node.\n- Peers which provide a chain with less work than the minimum-chain-work during IBD will now be disconnected.\n- For a given outbound peer, we now check whether their best known block has at least as much work as our tip. If it\ndoesn't, and if we still haven't heard about a block with sufficient work after a 20 minute timeout, then we send\na single getheaders message, and wait 2 more minutes. If after two minutes their best known block has insufficient\nwork, we disconnect that peer. We protect 4 of our outbound peers from being disconnected by this logic to prevent\nexcessive network topology changes as a result of this algorithm, while still ensuring that we have a reasonable\nnumber of nodes not known to be on bogus chains.\n- Outbound (non-manual) peers that serve us block headers that are already known to be invalid (other than compact\nblock announcements, because BIP 152 explicitly permits nodes to relay compact blocks before fully validating them)\nwill now be disconnected.\n- If the chain tip has not been advanced for over 30 minutes, we now assume the tip may be stale and will try to connect\nto an additional outbound peer. A periodic check ensures that if this extra peer connection is in use, we will disconnect\nthe peer that least recently announced a new block.\n- The set of all known invalid-themselves blocks (i.e. blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be\ninvalid) are now tracked and used to check if new headers build on an invalid chain. This ensures that everything that\ndescends from an invalid block is marked as such.\nMiner block size limiting deprecated\n------------------------------------\nThough blockmaxweight has been preferred for limiting the size of blocks returned by\ngetblocktemplate since 0.13.0, blockmaxsize remained as an option for those who wished\nto limit their block size directly. Using this option resulted in a few UI issues as\nwell as non-optimal fee selection and ever-so-slightly worse performance, and has thus\nnow been deprecated. Further, the blockmaxsize option is now used only to calculate an\nimplied blockmaxweight, instead of limiting block size directly. Any miners who wish\nto limit their blocks by size, instead of by weight, will have to do so manually by\nremoving transactions from their block template directly.\nGUI settings backed up on reset\n-------------------------------\nThe GUI settings will now be written to `guisettings.ini.bak` in the data directory before wiping them when\nthe `-resetguisettings` argument is used. This can be used to retroactively troubleshoot issues due to the\nGUI settings.\nDuplicate wallets disallowed\n----------------------------\nPreviously, it was possible to open the same wallet twice by manually copying the wallet file, causing\nissues when both were opened simultaneously. It is no longer possible to open copies of the same wallet.\nDebug `-minimumchainwork` argument added\n----------------------------------------\nA hidden debug argument `-minimumchainwork` has been added to allow a custom minimum work value to be used\nwhen validating a chain.\nLow-level RPC changes\n----------------------\n- The \"currentblocksize\" value in getmininginfo has been removed.\n- `dumpwallet` no longer allows overwriting files. This is a security measure\nas well as prevents dangerous user mistakes.\n- `backupwallet` will now fail when attempting to backup to source file, rather than\ndestroying the wallet.\n- `listsinceblock` will now throw an error if an unknown `blockhash` argument\nvalue is passed, instead of returning a list of all wallet transactions since\nthe genesis block. The behaviour is unchanged when an empty string is provided.\n0.15.1 Change log\n=================\n### Mining\n- #11100 `7871a7d` Fix confusing blockmax{size,weight} options, dont default to throwing away money (TheBlueMatt)\n### RPC and other APIs\n- #10859 `2a5d099` gettxout: Slightly improve doc and tests (jtimon)\n- #11267 `b1a6c94` update cli for estimate\\*fee argument rename (laanwj)\n- #11483 `20cdc2b` Fix importmulti bug when importing an already imported key (pedrobranco)\n- #9937 `a43be5b` Prevent `dumpwallet` from overwriting files (laanwj)\n- #11465 `405e069` Update named args documentation for importprivkey (dusty-wil)\n- #11131 `b278a43` Write authcookie atomically (laanwj)\n- #11565 `7d4546f` Make listsinceblock refuse unknown block hash (ryanofsky)\n- #11593 `8195cb0` Work-around an upstream libevent bug (theuni)\n### P2P protocol and network code\n- #11397 `27e861a` Improve and document SOCKS code (laanwj)\n- #11252 `0fe2a9a` When clearing addrman clear mapInfo and mapAddr (instagibbs)\n- #11527 `a2bd86a` Remove my testnet DNS seed (schildbach)\n- #10756 `0a5477c` net processing: swap out signals for an interface class (theuni)\n- #11531 `55b7abf` Check that new headers are not a descendant of an invalid block (more effeciently) (TheBlueMatt)\n- #11560 `49bf090` Connect to a new outbound peer if our tip is stale (sdaftuar)\n- #11568 `fc966bb` Disconnect outbound peers on invalid chains (sdaftuar)\n- #11578 `ec8dedf` Add missing lock in ProcessHeadersMessage(...)

From personal experience I know that - for example - Americans are can be offended by language that people from the UK are indifferent to, or even see as endearing, what to one person imbues a post with spirit and character to another renders it offensive.\nBut of course nobody wants to have to 'listen' to someone hurling unnecessary and unwarranted abuse at another poster, so there is a real need to keep a check on this kind of thing, at least to some degree.\nI suggest you make a distinction between swearing per se and ad hominem, for example here are two examples . . .\nA) Oh, for fuck's sake I can't believe they've increased their fucking charges for THE SECOND TIME in a freaking month!

Yet time after time you get it wrong and end up with the whole forum laughing at the sorry spectacle you have become, mostly through your own stupidity . . . (and so on)\n. . . example A contains swearing yet is (to these ears at least) not in the least bit offensive, example B is pure ad hominem, likely to elicit a similar response and is corrosive to the conversation.\nIf on the other hand there is simply going to be a list of censored words then why not just use the BB software to track and change them, much like a US religious forum, so '\nshit\n' becomes '\npoopy\n' - and 'no fucking way!' becomes 'no damn way'.\nPersonally I think this kind of thing is a move in the wrong direction, I am a member of a cycling forum in the UK that has zero moderation and the tone and sense of community is something even the best drawn up list of rules could not come close to, the forum has grown from nothing to 50,000 + and suffers none of the problems lists of rules like these seek to address.\nIt's fucking great !\n"}, {"date": "2011-06-21 12:43:58", "content": "What happened to my thread \"how to send many emails\"?

I would be happy if you provide the link or say me about full policy.\nThere is no fixed answer to that question. There is no exact \"policy\", nor can there be a policy that is good enough for determining spam/low quality posts. Easy examples of posts that get answered are posts that contain only emoticons, a good amount of posts that contain only 1 word (e.g. \"watching\"), posts that contain only insults (without any other input), etc. This is definitely not a \"sick policy\". This is a privately owned forum, and as such can enact any set of rules that the owners decide on.
